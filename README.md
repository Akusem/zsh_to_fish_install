# zsh_to_fish_install
A simple install script for my personnal usage based on [zsh_to_fish](https://github.com/abhigenie92/zsh_to_fish).

It install zsh, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh), 3 plugins ([zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions),
[zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search), [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)) 
for a fish-like experience
and a theme ([spaceship](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)) automatically.

## Usage

Just copy-paste the following line:
```bash
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akusem/zsh_to_fish_install/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you are already in zsh, you will need,  or to reload the terminal, or paste this line:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
